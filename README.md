# OpenVault
[Obsidian](http://obsidian.md) is a awesome tool for note taking and creating a so called "second brain". However, it lacks a bit of a vault management and may be a bit frustrating to launch a particular vault at times (especially if like me, you change the vaults frequently). This app solves the issue.

If you want to have the obsidian on the taskbar and at the same time to have the option to choose the vault, with a right click on the app while pinned on the taskbar, you can open a desired vault.

The application is not ready to go, you will have to modify the source code according to your preference and vaults. This ought to server as a template of some sort.

# How to install
1. Compile the source in Visual Studio
2. Add the app to the taskbar
3. Run the app for the first time (nothing is supposed to happen)
4. You can now right click the app and run any vault
